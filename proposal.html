<p>The Common Build Infrastructure (CBI) project is a proposed open source project under the <a
	href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project_summary.php?projectid=technology">Technology
Project</a>.</p>

<!-- 
	The communication channel must be specified. Typically, this is the
	"Proposals" forum. In general, you don't need to change this.
 -->
<p>This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse
community. Please send all feedback to the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/eclipse.proposals">Eclipse Proposals</a>
Forum.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<!-- 
	Optionally provide the background that has lead you to creating this project.
 -->

<p>The Eclipse Foundation hosts a large number of projects. Historically, each project has implemented their
own build system with mixed results. Given the importance of an repeatable and maintainable build, this project
was born. The Common Build Infrastructure aims to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make it really easy to build Eclipse projects</li>
  <li>Make it really easy to sign jar files and other artifacts</li>
  <li>Make it easier for new projects to set up their build</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<!-- 
	All projects must have a well-defined scope. Describe, concisely, what
	is in-scope and (optionally) what is out-of-scope. An Eclipse project
	cannot have an open-ended scope.
 -->

<p>The Common Build Infrastructure (CBI) project maintains and develops the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jar signing service</li>
  <li>Operating system signing service</li>
  <li>Maven plugins used for Eclipse builds</li>
  <li>Common Eclipse license files</li>
</ul>


<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe the project here. Be concise, but provide enough information that
	somebody who doesn't already know very much about your project idea or domain
	has at least a fighting chance of understanding its purpose.
 -->
 
<h2>Why Eclipse?</h2> 

<!-- 
	Answer these two questions:	What value does this project bring to the Eclipse
	community? What value do you expect to obtain from hosting your project at Eclipse?
	
	What value do you get by having your project at Eclipse over and above the value
	of hosting at Eclipse Labs?
 -->

<p>Given the Eclipse-focused background and scope, creating CBI as a project itself hosted at 
the Eclipse Foundation is very natural. CBI makes setting up and maintaining project builds easier.
Creating the CBI project allows people to contribute to CBI on equal footing and hopefully will
assist in growing a community for CBI over time.</p>


<h2>Initial Contribution</h2>

<!-- 
	Projects are expected to arrive at Eclipse with existing code.
	
	Describe the existing code that will be contributed to the project. Please provide
	a couple of paragraphs describing the code with modest detail, including important
	information like code ownership (who holds the copyright?), and some consideration
	of community that exists around the code. Include a listing of third-party libraries 
	and associated licenses.
 -->

<p>CBI code is licensed under a mix of EPL and EDL code.</p>

<p>Copyright for the CBI project's initial contribution is held by the Eclipse Foundation, SAP, IBM, and Red Hat.</p>

<p>The initial contribution is hosted by the Eclipse Foundation already at the following URL:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/cbi/org.eclipse.cbi.maven.plugins.git">Git Repository for Maven plugins</a></li>
  <li><a href="git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/cbi/org.eclipse.license.git">Git repository for the common license files</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/cbi/signing-service.git/">Git repository for the signing service</a></li>
</ul>


<p>TODO: talk about our prerequisites</p>

 
<h2>Legal Issues</h2>

<!-- 
	Please describe any potential legal issues in this section. Does somebody else
	own the trademark to the project name? Is there some issue that prevents you
	from licensing the project under the Eclipse Public License? Are parts of the 
	code available under some other license? Are there any LGPL/GPL bits that you
	absolutely require?
 -->

<p>We do not believe there are any legal issues lurking in CBI.</p>

 
<h2>Committers</h2>

<!-- 
	List any initial committers that should be provisioned along with the
	new project. Include affiliation, but do not include email addresses at
	this point.
 -->
  

<p>The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to the project:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Thanh Ha, Eclipse Foundation</dt>
	<dd>Thanh is a committer on the CBI project where he has made significant contributions over
	the past year. He will be developing and maintaining: the signing service; the operating system
        signing service; and Maven plugins.</dd>
	<dt>Paul Webster, IBM</dt>
	<dd>Paul Webster is a power user and periodic contributor to CBI. He was a sigificant contributor to the efforts to deploy CBI for
        The Eclipse Platform project.</dd>
	<dt>Krzysztof Daniel, Red Hat</dt>
	<dd>Krzysztof is a power user and periodic contributor to CBI. He was a sigificant contributor to the efforts to deploy CBI for
        The Eclipse Platform project.</dd>
	<dt>David Williams, IBM</dt>
	<dd>David is a power user and periodic contributor to CBI. He was a sigificant contributor to the efforts to deploy CBI for
        The Eclipse Platform project. 
</dl>

<p>We welcome additional committers and contributions.</p>

<!-- 
	Describe any initial contributions of code that will be brought to the 
	project. If there is no existing code, just remove this section.
 -->

<h2>Mentors</h2>

<!-- 
	New Eclipse projects require a minimum of two mentors from the Architecture
	Council. You need to identify two mentors before the project is created. The
	proposal can be posted before this section is filled in (it's a little easier
	to find a mentor when the proposal itself is public).
 -->

<p>The following Architecture Council members will mentor this
project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mentor 1</li>
	<li>Mentor 2</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested Parties</h2>

<!-- 
	Provide a list of individuals, organisations, companies, and other Eclipse
	projects that are interested in this project. This list will provide some
	insight into who your project's community will ultimately include. Where
	possible, include affiliations. Do not include email addresses.
 -->

<p>The following individuals, organisations, companies and projects have 
expressed interest in this project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Andrew Ross, Eclipse Foundation</li>
  <li>Gunnar Wagenknecht, Tasktop</li>

<h2>Project Scheduling</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe, in rough terms, what the basic scheduling of the project will
	be. You might, for example, include an indication of when an initial contribution
	should be expected, when your first build will be ready, etc. Exact
	dates are not required.
